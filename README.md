## Description

NodeJS is wrapped around Tensorflow Convolutional Neural Network. <br>

CNN was trained with [Classic MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). <br>
Training code is [here](https://bitbucket.org/framegenerator/nnplayground/src/a703181194a1e17c3d053ed06a293e682c091191/6.CNN_tf_softmax_mnist_dropout/?at=master). <br>
How dataset was converted into CSV you can find [here](https://github.com/egcode/MNIST-to-CSV).
